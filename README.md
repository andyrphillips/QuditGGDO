# Qudit-Based Generalized Grover Diffusion Operator

<p>This codebase serves as a generalized multi-qudit generalized Grover diffusion operator simulator, AKA Many-valued Grover Search on multi-dimensional qubits known as qudits. This project is Cirq-based and is designed to handle qudits of any dimension d and with any number of qudits nq.</p>

  
<p>Still need to update state tracking and histogram labels for arbitrary d and n</p>
