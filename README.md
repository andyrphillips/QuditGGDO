# Qudit-Based Generalized Grover Diffusion Operator

<p>This codebase serves as a generalized multi-qudit generalized Grover diffusion operator simulator, AKA Grover Search on multi-dimensional qubits known as qudits. This project is Cirq-based and is designed to handle qudits of any dimension d and with any number of qudits nq.
